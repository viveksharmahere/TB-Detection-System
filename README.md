# Tuberculosis Detection System using CNN

This project uses a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to automatically detect **Tuberculosis (TB)** from chest X-ray images. The system classifies images into two categories: TB Positive and TB Negative.

## Features:
- Data preprocessing and augmentation
- Custom data generator for efficient loading and training
- CNN architecture with convolution, max-pooling, and dropout layers
- Trained and evaluated on a dataset of chest X-ray images

## Technologies Used:
- **TensorFlow** and **Keras** for deep learning
- **NumPy** for data manipulation
- **Matplotlib** for data visualization
- **scikit-learn** for data splitting
