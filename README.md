# TB-Detection-System
This project aims to build a machine learning model using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for detecting Tuberculosis (TB) from chest radiographs (X-rays). The system classifies the given chest X-ray images into two categories: Tuberculosis (TB) Positive And Tuberculosis (TB) Negative.
